Our mission is to take the friction out of content creation. We wanted a blogging platform that is easy to use, developer friendly - and that makes content creation a pleasure, so we built one with Next.js and MDX.

**Why MDXBlog?**

MDXblog stores posts as markdown files on the local machine, eliminating the need for a round trip to a database every time we want to write or edit a post. Content creation with local files just feels more intuitive. We can even create content in our favorite text editor or IDE.

MDX blog uses MDX format which gives us the power to include React components directly in the Markdown documents. This means we can include interactive elements like forms, buttons, and more in our posts, in a more developer-friendly way.

**Key Features:**

- **Style as You Write**: MDX content is styled with Markdown syntax, which allows styling without needing to lift your fingers from the keyboard.
- **Quick Post Creation**: In development mode, creating a new post is as simple as clicking a '+' icon in the nav bar. It instantly generates a new post for you to start writing.
- **Scheduled Publishing**: Set future dates for your posts, and MDXBlog will ensure they go live when they’re supposed to—no manual intervention required.
- **Custom Components**: Seamlessly add YouTube videos, images, and code snippets to your posts using built-in React components.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Next.js handles the rendering of your content, ensuring it loads quickly and is SEO friendly. You can focus on writing, and MDXBlog takes care of the rest.
