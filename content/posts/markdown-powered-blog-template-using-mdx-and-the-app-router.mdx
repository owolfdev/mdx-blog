### Using MDX with Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind, and ShadCN

**MDX** lets you write Markdown content enhanced with JSX. It’s ideal for content-driven apps where you want the power of React inside rich text — perfect for blogs, documentation, and interactive pages.

---

## ✅ App Router + MDX

Next.js 16 with the App Router supports MDX smoothly.

To load an MDX file dynamically:

```tsx
const post = await import(`@/content/posts/${slug}.mdx`);
```

Then render it using `@/next/mdx` compiled output. Use `useMDXComponents` to register any global components you want available in all MDX files.

---

## 🧪 Example: ShadCN Button in MDX

Because we’ve already registered the ShadCN `Button` in our `useMDXComponents` config, we can use it in MDX **without needing to import it**:

import { AlertDialogDemo } from "@/components/alert-dialog-demo";

<div className="flex flex-col items-center py-4 gap-2">
  Example:
  <AlertDialogDemo />
</div>

```mdx
## Example with globally registered Button

<Button variant="outline">Click me</Button>
```

Alternatively, you can import it manually if you prefer:

```mdx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

## Example with local import

<Button variant="default">I was imported manually</Button>
```

Both approaches render the same styled component — choose based on your project's organization or preference.
