MDX is a file format that combines Markdown with JSX, allowing developers to seamlessly embed React components within Markdown documents, enabling dynamic and interactive content creation. It facilitates the creation of rich, interactive documentation and blog posts in web development projects. MDX blends Markdown's straightforward syntax with the capability to embed dynamic JSX elements. Perfect for interactive, rich-content blogs.
