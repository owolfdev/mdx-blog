## More About <span className="text-primary">MDX</span>Blog

[See the installation options for MDXBlog](/install).

Unlike some blogging solutions that rely on a database to store content, content management in MDXBlog is handled by easily editable Markdown (mdx) files in a folder on your local machine! Content creation with local files just feels more intuitive.

MDXBlog is a free, Next.js template project that is easy to install and deploy. It's an app built with the latest web technologies, offering a unique blogging experience. Using MDX (Markdown + JSX) and Next.js 14, it generates static pages that are fast, secure, and SEO-friendly. The app is designed to be easy to use and customize, with a clean, modern design that is fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

We have no official affiliation with the MDX team or Next.js, we are simply fans of the technology and wanted to create a simple, free, easy-to-use blog template for ourselves and to share with any other interested developers.

Please consider [donating](/donate) to support our vision and help us continue to provide our blog template for the MDX community.

MDX is a file format that combines Markdown with JSX, allowing developers to seamlessly embed React components within Markdown documents, enabling dynamic and interactive content creation. It facilitates the creation of rich, interactive documentation and blog posts in web development projects. MDX blends Markdown's straightforward syntax with the capability to embed dynamic JSX elements. Perfect for interactive, rich-content blogs. It's a good solution for those who appreciate the ease of Markdown and the power of React components.
